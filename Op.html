<h2>Almost a millennium ago, a mighty ancient kingdom ruled the world. Twenty ambitious kings joined forces to annihilate it, erasing any trace of its existence and establishing the World Government, which still governs the world today. The period that followed, known as the Void Century, conceals untold secrets.<br>

Some centuries later, a pirate named Gol D. Roger emerged, amassing vast power, wealth, and influence. His ideals of freedom and rebellion posed a grave threat to the World Government, leading them to seek his capture. Roger eventually surrendered himself, but just before his execution, he disclosed the existence of the world's greatest treasure, the One Piece, hidden at the end of the Grand Line, a perilous sea.<br>

This revelation marked the beginning of the Great Pirate Era, as people embarked on dangerous journeys to find the One Piece and become the Pirate King. Among them is a young boy named Monkey D. Luffy.<br>

One day, Luffy accidentally eats the Gomu Gomu no Mi, a magical Devil Fruit that turns his body into rubber. Inspired by his transformation, as well as a pirate crew known as the Shanks, Luffy vows to become the Pirate King. His sole goal: become the freest person in the world.<br>

During his journey, Luffy assembles a diverse crew, including Zoro, the swordsman; Nami, the navigator; Usopp, the sharpshooter; and Sanji, the chef. Together, they become known as the Straw Hat Pirates (named after Luffy's iconic straw hat gifted to him by the Shanks) and acquire the Going Merry, a ship cherished like a crew member.<br>

The Straw Hats sail towards the Grand Line. They encounter two bounty hunters—Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday—headed for Whiskey Log Island. Luffy acquires a Log Pose, a non-standard compass capable of navigating the Grand Line's unique magnetic fields.<br>

In Whiskey Peaks, the crew discovers Miss Wednesday's true identity as Nefertari Vivi, a noble who temporarily allies with them. They also welcome Tony Tony Chopper as their new doctor. Additionally, they uncover the existence of Baroque Works, a criminal syndicate aiming to destroy the Arabasta Kingdom.<br>

Surprisingly, the leader of Baroque Works, Mr. 0, is revealed to be Crocodile, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea; Vivi is working undercover as a spy against them. Luffy initially faces defeat twice at the hands of Crocodile, but their third clash results in Luffy's triumph. In Arabasta, the crew encounters Nico Robin, who becomes their archaeologist.<br>

After their adventure in Arabasta and Skypiea, the Straw Hats arrive in Water 7, where they clash with a group of bounty hunters called the Franky Family and the World Government's agent, CP9. Amid this crisis, they recruit Franky as their shipwright, joining forces to conquer CP9. This victory elevates the Straw Hats' status as a major threat, resulting in bounties for each crew member.<br>br>

Franky commits to building a new ship to replace the Going Merry, resulting in the creation of the Thousand Sunny. In a solemn ceremony, the Going Merry is given a Viking funeral. Meanwhile, Luffy's foster brother, Ace, encounters Blackbeard, the pirate he has been seeking. The encounter sparks a duel and sets the stage for a looming war.<br>

Luffy's lineage is unveiled: He is the son of Dragon, the infamous Supreme Commander of the Revolutionary Army and, according to the World Government, the “World's Worst Criminal.” Portgas D. Ace is revealed to be the son of Gol D. Roger; however, Ace faces a tragic end during a confrontation with Marine Admiral Akainu. Upon finding closure with Ace's death, Luffy and Rayleigh, Luffy's mentor and ally, conclude that the crew is not ready for...</h2>
