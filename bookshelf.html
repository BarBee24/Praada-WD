<p><br>The Psychology of Money</br> explores how emotions, biases, and behavior shape our financial decisions—often more than pure logic and technical knowledge. Morgan Housel shares timeless lessons through compelling storytelling, drawing on history, psychology, and his own experiences.</p>
<p>One of its key insights is that financial success doesn't depend on knowing complex formulas, but on how you behave—how patient, frugal, and consistent you are. The book emphasizes the power of long-term thinking and the unpredictability of markets, making it a must-read not just for investors but anyone who interacts with money.</p>
<p>This book is a refreshing take on wealth-building that celebrates humility, self-awareness, and the emotional intelligence behind financial decisions. Highly recommended for beginners and experts alike. Read It If You Are A Barca Fan.</p>

<p><br>Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).</p>
